### What is `targetAmountPolicy?`

The `targetAmountPolicy`field provides the means for specifying the withdrawal amount either in `FIAT` currency or `CRYPTO` currency. When `FIAT` is selected as policy the resulting amount of the withdrawal in crypto will be calculated according to the fiat amount passed in `targetAmount` field. When `CRYPTO` is selected as policy the resulting amount of the withdrawal will be exactly the same as the amount passed in `targetAmount` field (subject to a negligible difference due to market conditions i.e. market step size)

```javascript
{
    'withdrawCurrency': 'XRP',
    'displayCurrency': 'EUR',
    'targetAmount': '20',
    'targetAmountPolicy': 'FIAT'
}

//This translates to "Withdraw 20 EUR worth of XRP"
```

```javascript
{
    'withdrawCurrency': 'XRP',
    'displayCurrency': 'EUR',
    'targetAmount': '200',
    'targetAmountPolicy': 'CRYPTO'
}

//This translates to "Withdraw 200 XRP"
```
