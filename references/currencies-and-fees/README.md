# Currencies & Fees

Currently we support 20+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies for pairing. The following endpoints will help you check if a specific cryptocurrency is available for withdrawal and fetch the accompanied withdrawal fees bound to it. We pass on the fees we receive from our liquidity network.

In addition you will be able to fetch the most recent exchange rates for all cryptocurrencies paired with fiat currencies and all fiat exchange rates.

For fiat exchange rates we use [https://openexchangerates.org/](https://openexchangerates.org/)

Fiat exchange rates are updated every 30 minutes.

Cryptocurrency exchange rates are real-time and are derived by our network of liquidity providers. We make sure to always get you the best exchange rate across our liquidity network. Exchange rates endpoints are public and you are welcome to compare them with your favourite exchange.
