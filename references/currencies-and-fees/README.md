# Currencies & Fees

Currently we support 20+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies for pairing. The following endpoints will help you check if a specific cryptocurrency is available for withdrawal and fetch the accompanied withdrawal fees bound to it. We pass on the fees we receive from our liquidity network.

In addition you will be able to fetch the most recent exchange rates for all cryptocurrencies paired with fiat currencies. Due to the nature of cryptocurrencies we update the exchange rates every 20 seconds.
