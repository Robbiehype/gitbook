# API Management

API credentials are managed directly from the [Finrax Dashboard](https://dashboard.finrax.com) by employees with Manager and Admin roles in the Finrax system.   
By going to **"Settings -&gt; API keys"** and clicking **“New Key”** button you can create as many API credentials as needed.

Upon successful API credentials creation you will be provided with the values for the **API key** and **API secret**. You must store the **API secret** securely, by writing it down or copying it in your application code immediately, as it will be displayed in plaintext only once.

**If you lose your API secret or it becomes compromised you must delete the API credentials pair immediately and generate a new one.**
